# Starlit Adventure
  
## A text-base game set in a fantasy world with elves, dragons, fairies, and more. You start in an unfamiliar location next to a sleeping dragon and end by placing the Skydrop on a pedestal in the Sha dowforceMystery Forest.
  
__On the way, you will collect:__
- Armor (goblin-made, dwarf-made, elf-made, and the legendary Lightstone Armor)
- Weapons (in a set with the armor, weapons and armor are found not in a set)
- Bottles (for putting all kinds of things in, similar to Legend of Zelda)
- Useful Items (grappling hooks, money, valuable materials, etc.)
- Pets (cats, dogs, a horse)
  
AND
- Random bits of information (locations, uses for items, help for the main quest, recipes, spells you can't use)


 This is Isabella. I think this sounds like a really fun idea. Exept, at the end of your list, you said, speel s you can't use. Was that a typo? Do you eventually learn the spells? I really like this storyline. And I have a few questions that we can decide together about the game.
-  Will there be battles to fight to gain points? I sort of think it would be more fun not to have them , so the player could just focus on the story.
-  What will the player decisions look like? will they be multiple choice questions or something else?
- I also think we probably should eventually write some narative and diolouge. Bc won't that be the base of the game? I think this game will take a lot of creativity. I'm excited about that. 

If we want to just write to each other in here, I think we could if I remembeer to look at it regularly.
